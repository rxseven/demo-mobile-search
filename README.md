## Live Demo

**MSFP** is hosted and running on **Heroku** at [https://playground-mobile-search.herokuapp.com](https://playground-mobile-search.herokuapp.com)

> **App sleeping...** as **MSFP** run on a free plan, when an app on Heroku has only one web dyno and that dyno doesnâ€™t receive any traffic in 1 hour, the dyno goes to sleep. When someone accesses the app, the dyno manager will automatically wake up the web dyno to run the web process type. **This causes a short delay for this first request**, but subsequent requests will perform normally. For more information, see [App Sleeping on Heroku](https://blog.heroku.com/app_sleeping_on_heroku).
