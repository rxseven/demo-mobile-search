## Live Demo

**MSFP** is hosted and running on **Heroku** at [https://playground-mobile-search.herokuapp.com](https://playground-mobile-search.herokuapp.com)

> **App sleeping...** as **MSFP** run on a free plan, when an app on Heroku has only one web dyno and that dyno doesn’t receive any traffic in 1 hour, the dyno goes to sleep. When someone accesses the app, the dyno manager will automatically wake up the web dyno to run the web process type. **This causes a short delay for this first request**, but subsequent requests will perform normally. For more information, see [App Sleeping on Heroku](https://blog.heroku.com/app_sleeping_on_heroku).

## Browser Support

Because this project uses CSS3 features, it’s only meant for modern browsers. Some browsers currently fail to apply some of the styles correctly.

Chrome and Firefox have full support, but Safari and IE have strange behaviors.
